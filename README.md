## XYZ-Shop-System 🛒

<p>This project 📚 was assigned to me as part of the Object-Oriented Programming course at the Islamic University. The objective of the project was to develop an expanded version of XYZ Shop, with a focus on incorporating the fundamental concepts of inheritance and polymorphism, while introducing new functionalities to enhance the program's capabilities.</p>

<p>💻 Throughout the development process, Java Collection classes were utilized to effectively manage comprehensive lists of Customers, Sellers, and items, ensuring efficient data management 📋. Users were provided with the flexibility to assume the roles of either a Seller or a Customer, each with their own distinct capabilities and responsibilities. Sellers were empowered to add their own products to the system, providing detailed information and exercising control over them. On the other hand, Customers were able to create new orders 📦, select products from those offered by Sellers, access invoices and orders, and evaluate Sellers based on their experiences 📈.</p>

<p>Moreover, a single Admin will hold exclusive control over all aspects of the store 🔒. The Admin will have the authority to manage user accounts, oversee product listings, and handle order processing. This centralized control will contribute to the overall efficiency and security of the system, providing a seamless experience for both Sellers and Customers 📊.</p>
